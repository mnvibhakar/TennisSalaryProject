    "Tennis is a sport enjoyed by millions of people around the world. It involves two to four players competing against each other to hit a ball over a net with rackets. Professional tennis players compete in various tournaments throughout the year, accruing prize money based on their performance. Understanding the potential earnings of top players in the upcoming season is crucial for fans, sponsors and the players themselves.\n",

    "The question our project aims to answer is: How much will a tennis player earn next season? To answer this question, we will use a dataset called \"Player Statistics for Top 500 Players\". This dataset contains comprehensive information on the top 500 tennis players, including their personal information, rankings, prize money earned in previous seasons and so on. It provides a valuable resource for analyzing historical trends and predicting future bonus earnings."
